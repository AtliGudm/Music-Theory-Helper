It now contains a Scale Finder where you input notes (via text input or visual piano keyboard) and it tells you what musical scales contain those notes, you can also fuzzy search for scales by name, see all of the diatonic chords of each scale and also it's relative and parallel mode.
You can also see 7th chords, view chords vertically or horizontally, and tons of more features!!
