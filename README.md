# Music-Theory-Helper

This project was made as a practice project to learn React and TypeScript. It's tools to help with music theory and composing, there are a ton of programs that provide very similar features but this is custom made to my specific requirements.

It now only contains a Scale Finder where you input notes and it tells you what musical scales contain those notes, you can also fuzzy search for scales by name. You can then see all of the diatonic chords of each scale and also it's relative and parallel mode.
It's still not completely finished.
