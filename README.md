# Music-Theory-Helper

This project was made to learn React and TypeScript. It's tools to help with music theory and composing, there are programs that provide somewhat similar features but this is tailor made to my specific requirements.

It now contains a Scale Finder where you input notes and it tells you what musical scales contain those notes, you can also fuzzy search for scales by name. You can then see all of the diatonic chords of each scale and also it's relative and parallel mode.
You can also see 7th chords, suspended chords, view chords vertically or horizontally, and tons of more features!!

- Add favorites/pinned functionality

Future features:
- Add setting for how notes with double accidentals are displayed
- Create Unit/Integration Tests
- Start work on "The Modulator", a tool to help with modulating between keys/scales

Fix:
- Fix: flat signs are being capitalized in modes like 'Dorian b5'
- Fix: how enharmonics are forced when using Piano Keyboard note input
- Revamp the Include Suspended Chords functionality
