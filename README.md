# Music-Theory-Helper

This project was just made as a practice project to learn ReactJS. It's a bunch of tools to help with music theory and composing, there are a ton of programs that provide very similar features, but this is custom made to my specific requirements.

It now only contains a Scale Finder, you input notes and it tells you what musical scales contain those notes. You can then see all of the diatonic chords of each scale and also it's relative mode.
I'ts still rough visually and is still not completely finished.

Other features and tools will be added soon.
