# Music-Theory-Helper

This project was just made as a practice project to learn React and TypeScript. It's a bunch of tools to help with music theory and composing, there are a ton of programs that provide very similar features, but this is custom made to my specific requirements.

It now only contains a Scale Finder, you input notes and it tells you what musical scales contain those notes. You can then see all of the diatonic chords of each scale and also it's relative mode.
I'ts still rough visually and is still not completely finished.

Other features and tools will be added soon.

TODO:
- Add fuzzy search for finding scales and modes of scales by name
- Add setting for how notes with double accidentals are displayed
- Improve button clickable areas (Now it's not obvious/intuitive what you can click)
- Add Scales: Diminished, Whole Tone(Also leading?), Major and Minor Pentatonic, and maybe other exotic scales(not a priority)
- Add interactive piano to input notes
- (Use interactive piano to display chosen scale? Chosen chord even?)
- Create Unit/Integration Tests
- Highlight matched notes in scales and chords
- Have option to see other chords diatonic to the scale, like sus2 and sus4 chords
- Add button to see the corresponding harmonic and melodic minor chords of a natural minor scale
